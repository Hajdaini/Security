# Description :

This script launches any executable (.exe) for each Windows computer reboot. **I did this for learning purposes and encourage you to do the same!**

# Before running the script :

- This programm works only on windows OS
- You must run the script as an administrator. The problem is that I have not managed to find a way to run a python file as an administrator, the alternative to solve this obstacle is to turn this python script into an executable file (.exe) using this command for example :

  ```
  pip install pyinstaller
  pyinstaller runner.py
  ```

# How to use it :

1. run the script as admin

  ![run as admin](img/run_as_admin.jpg)

2. Enter full path of your exe file

   ![launch](img/launch.jpg)
